								The Spark: A Nurse's Perspective
							</h2>
							<p class="mb-4">
								My years on the front lines of nursing have been incredibly
								rewarding, but they also revealed a significant gap in our
								healthcare system: the disconnect between the growing demand for
								flexible, high-quality home care and the underutilized potential
								of freelance nursing professionals. I saw nurses yearning for
								autonomy and better work-life balance, and clients struggling to
								find reliable, localized care tailored to their needs.
							</p>
							<p class="mb-4">
								This realization sparked a question: "What if we could bridge
								this gap with technology and a community-driven approach?" I
								envisioned a world where nurses could truly thrive, setting
								their own schedules and rates, while clients received prompt,
								professional care right at their doorstep.
							</p>
							<p>
								It was a daunting idea, stepping beyond traditional nursing
								roles into entrepreneurship. But my passion for patient
								well-being and empowering my fellow nurses fueled every step.
								I've poured my experience and dedication into building this
								platform, ensuring it's intuitive, reliable, and truly
								transformative for home healthcare.
